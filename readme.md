#Neural Style Transfer Python Program:
This is done as part of Convolutional Neural Network Course 
of Deep Learning Specialization




##Command to run the program:

python main.py -c "<path to content image>" -s "<path to style image>


##Example:
$python main.py -c "./images/louvre_small.jpg" -s "./images/monet.jpg"



##NB:

1. Output Image would be shown in the output folder.
2. Download the pretrained model from https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat.
3. Add the pretained model inside the pretrained-model folder
